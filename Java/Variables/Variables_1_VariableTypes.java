	-> Static Variables: Static variables are declared using the static keyword within a class outside any method constructor or block.
    -> Unlike instance variables, we can only have only copy of a static variable per class irrespective of how many objects we create.
    -> Static variables are created at start of program execution and destroyed automatically when execution ends.
    -> To access static variables, we need not to create any object of that class, we can simply access the variable as:
		class_name.variable_name;
    -> Unlike C++, Java doesnâ€™t support static local variables. For example, the following Java program fails in compilation.
